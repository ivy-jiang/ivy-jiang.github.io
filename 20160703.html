It's quite apparent from just existing on planet earth that there are some things in life that don't go your way. Recently, having dealt with an extremely difficult revelation, I found out more about myself than I would have if I were to go by without any qualms. So the silver lining in difficult times is that you will learn quickly. Even if you feel like you can't extract enough positivity out of what happened, at least you've got another hardship under your belt. Any type or level of hardship, include them all. These hardships and tough times are achievements in themselves, because you're still standing and here to live another day. </p>
<p>
  Now there's the notion floating around that-"oh, well, other people got it worse than you". That may or may not be true, and it may or may not help put things into perspective. But that often isn't the most effective way to deal with tough times, so be careful when you use that argument.
</p>

<p>
  I don't know the best way to help a person when he or she is going through some difficulties. I haven't even found a foolproof way myself. Yet if the hardship regards another person's actions and behavior, then the best one can do is to try to forgive that person. This is definitely easier said than done, and in fact, not easy at all (who am I kidding). Besides, if one has unequivocally wronged another, it could be nearly impossible for anybody to truly forgive one and let that be it. But ultimately, I believe forgiveness is the pinnacle of human goodness. I admire it to a great extent and aspire to be able to show it when needed. My main reservation with forgiveness is the possibility of being the fool who gets fooled again and taken advantage of. Even still, you're always given the choice to how you choose to react or behave. You don't always have to forgive, but you can forgive. You have the possibility of choosing to do so. "Timshel" or "thou mayest" is what John Steinbeck's East of Eden has so aptly taught me, because regardless of what you're given and though there are things you cannot control, you may choose how you are to proceed. This is not absolute nor is it complete guidance. But I have certainly reminded myself that there is a choice, and we do not have to fall victim to overwhelming negativity.
