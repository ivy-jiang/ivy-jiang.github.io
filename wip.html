4 tracks to remember this past period
/s <i> warning; may or may not be kinda mainstream </i>
1. I know alone -HAIM
released in apr. not sure if they wrote the track during this time but hits a little close to home, alone.
also like Don't Wanna
2. you're gonna miss me when im not around -GRIMES
i guess u can say it to all the people at work (WFH)
but other than that aptness, it is such a refreshing , honest song.
miss anthropocene has some ultra cool hits, tbh. aside from the fact and notoriety surrounding grimes' child ('s name), the only positive is the extra publicity for her music
as someone who gets as much attention she does, her music is stil <i>sooooo</i> underrated.
3. after hours -THE WEEKND
i know.. kind of mainstream. but there was a period i only listneed to this song on repeat and it is a pretty cool song to run to, especially at 6am by the river in 8celsius weather (nice!)


4. THE NEW ABNORMAL - THE STROKES
yeah TNA is not a song. its an album
