                  I didn’t write for the past few weeks not because I had nothing to say. I did have <i>stuff</i> to say on various things. Olympics, sports, the trajectory of one’s life, health, wants, needs, language, music, barriers. You know, stuff. I attempted to start a few posts on some topics many times. But I had gotten cold on each of these posts after writing the first few sentences. This post even, I’m not sure will make it out alive. I guess it made it if you see this.
                  <p>
                  The reason, I now conclude, that I had been hitting a wall with things, is because I didn’t know the answers to the thoughts and perspectives that I harbored, which led to me not want to write about things I did not know. We can question everything till the end of time. What is knowledge? What is knowing? I don’t know much out of all the knowledge there is to know, trivial or significant. I may not know things and subsequent answers, but as long as I am open to learning more about the world and what can constitute the experience of a human being, then, I suppose, I can cautiously express thoughts at certain moments in time, knowing full well I am subject to change. I say this because I want to stray as far as I can from being ignorant.
                  <p>
                  So I didn’t write because I thought I didn’t know much, if anything at all. Then I realize, it’s okay because I want to learn and I am learning (until the end of my consciousness). Yet it’s also okay to have a voice, a documentation of a process, a train and trail of thoughts. Therefore I write. I think therefore I am. Yeah. I use the word “yeah” too much and it probably is not even a word.
                  <p>
                  Truth be told, I am very thankful to have this floating site that I can call my blog. If it isn’t evident (by its lack of quality or simply its strange nature), I created this site mainly for my own sanity. A little piece of refuge. A peace of mind. A shout into oblivion. Anyways. I am going back to school in a little less than a week and I hope I treasure all the moments there are to be treasured (which is every moment really, good or bad). I will miss home and its people. When I boil it down, all I want to do is to facilitate their happiness. (Starting from this point, this post, by indirect workings, does contribute to that, so so far so good).
                  <p>
                  I’ll be blogging more, especially since I am going back to school. I imagine my head will be in this mindset of wanting to write about things constantly. I am excited to take my Fall 2016 courses and thoroughly get acquainted with them.  I am also excited to see how the NBA season will unravel and new books I will read. I am excited to keep up with all that is happening back home. There will always be things to think about and write about.
