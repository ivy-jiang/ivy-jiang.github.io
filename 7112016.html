                      Chipotle. With its food safety problems over the past year, its stock price has tumbled dramatically. Prior to its food safety crisis and other PR related issues, Chipotle looked like it was going to be the next McDonalds. It could still be, though there is no way to spin food safety in any other way than what it is. Though McDonalds and Chipotle are competitors, I am a fan of both as long-term prospects. McDonalds still has the scale and Chipotle still has the appeal especially among young people despite its troubles. <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/09/better-buy-mcdonalds-corporation-vs-chipotle-mexic.aspx">This article makes some valid comparisons between the two.</a> Overall, I like both for the long-run. With Chipotle, it would take some time before the dust settles with its food safety problems. Once it gets its issues under control, and the public does not take too long to forget (or forgive), Chipotle will get back on track, albeit slightly slower than before. Both are big, well known brands, and they aren’t going anywhere any time soon, especially in vacillating market conditions.

                    <h5>
                      Not a huge fan of:</h5>
                      <p>
                      LinkedIn. It was acquired by Microsoft, and its shares were up 47% after the acquisition was announced in early June. The price of LinkedIn’s stock has remained relatively stable since its big jump, but I don’t see it increasing over the long run unless if LinkedIn becomes much more innovative than what it currently is. Microsoft acquired it for 26.2 billion, but I’d rather pay more and get Snapchat instead. (Like I totally can.) The influence and potential of Snapchat is much greater than LinkedIn. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivy-jiang-0b6116b0">I have a LinkedIn account but I don’t personally use it.</a> I am not a fan of the concept and execution of LinkedIn. I may go into detail on why I am not the biggest fan of LinkedIn but I will just mention briefly for now my reservations about the site:  it appeals to only a particular subset of people; the data it does have on users should be taken with a grain of salt; the actual use and purpose of a social networking site tailored towards ‘professionals’ are questionable.  My basis for staying away from LinkedIn, and perhaps subsequently (and sadly) Microsoft because of its expensive purchase of LinkedIn, is more from my personal view on the website than anything else. I am confounded by how analysts have touted its potential because at most, I saw it as a hollow site composed of vacuous profiles filled with exaggerated claims. It has yet to prove its credibility as a serious site, and maybe it’s because I’ve just not had much use for it.
