<h3>
                      Green light for the long run: Chipotle</h3>
                        <p>
                      With its food safety problems over the past year, its stock price has tumbled dramatically. Prior to its food safety crisis and other PR related issues, Chipotle looked like it was going to be the next McDonald's. It could still be, though there is no way to spin food safety in any other way than what it is. McDonald's and Chipotle are competitors, but I am still an avid fan of both as long-term prospects. McDonald's still has the scale and Chipotle still has the appeal especially among young people, despite its troubles. <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/09/better-buy-mcdonalds-corporation-vs-chipotle-mexic.aspx">This article makes some valid comparisons between the two.</a> With Chipotle, it would take some time before the dust settles with its food safety problems. Once it gets its issues under control, and the public does not take too long to forget (or forgive), Chipotle will get back on track, albeit slightly slower than before. McDonald's and Chipotle are big, well known brands, and they aren’t going anywhere any time soon, especially not in these vacillating market conditions.

                    </p>



    <h2 class="section-heading">Nein</h2>
                    <h3>
                      On the other hand: LinkedIn</h3>
                      <p>
                      It was acquired by Microsoft, and its shares were up 47% after the acquisition was announced in early June. The price of LinkedIn’s stock has remained relatively stable since its big jump, but I don’t see it increasing over the long run unless if LinkedIn becomes much more innovative than what it currently is. Microsoft acquired it for 26.2 billion, but I’d rather pay more and get Snapchat instead. (Like I totally can.) The influence and potential of Snapchat is much greater than those of LinkedIn. As the younger gen <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivy-jiang-0b6116b0">I have a LinkedIn account.</a> I may go into detail on why I am not the biggest fan of LinkedIn but I will just mention briefly for now my reservations:  it appeals to only a particular subset of people; the data it does have on users should be taken with a grain of salt. The user experience and interface can be improved upon. Many smaller, start-up sites have sleeker and more user-friendly interfaces than those of LinkedIn. <p><i><b>Note:</b> My good friend explained to me about the positive features of LinkedIn and I am starting to see a stronger appeal to it. </i>
